Recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"name\": \"Cookie and Kate\"}, \"keywords\": \"brown rice risotto\", \"image\": [\"https://cookieandkate.com/images/2018/08/easy-brown-rice-risotto-recipe-225x225.jpg\", \"https://cookieandkate.com/images/2018/08/easy-brown-rice-risotto-recipe-260x195.jpg\", \"https://cookieandkate.com/images/2018/08/easy-brown-rice-risotto-recipe-320x180.jpg\", \"https://cookieandkate.com/images/2018/08/easy-brown-rice-risotto-recipe.jpg\"], \"url\": \"https://cookieandkate.com/easy-brown-rice-risotto-with-mushrooms-and-fresh-oregano/\", \"recipeIngredient\": [\"3 tablespoons olive oil, divided\", \"1 small yellow onion, chopped\", \"2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced\", \"5 cups (40 ounces) vegetable broth, divided (if your broth comes in 32-ounce containers, feel free to avoid opening another container by substituting 1 cup water for 1 cup broth in step 3)\", \"1 1/2 cups brown arborio/short-grain brown rice\", \"12 to 14 ounces sliced Cremini (baby portobello) mushrooms, debris rinsed from mushrooms and drained\", \"1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese\", \"1/2 cup dry white wine, optional\", \"3 tablespoons unsalted butter, diced\", \"2 teaspoons tamari (for extra flavor, optional)*\", \"1 teaspoon sea salt, more to taste\", \"Freshly ground black pepper, to taste\", \"4 sprigs fresh oregano, leaves removed from stems and larger leaves torn into small pieces\"], \"recipeInstructions\": [{\"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"text\": \"Make sure your oven rack is in the middle position.

On another note, I will never understand American's insistence on using a unit of measurement intended for volume when weight is much simpler. If not explicitly labeled on the packaging, how is one supposed to measure 1/3 cup of butter? Something else occurred to me: placing the hot gravy sauce directly on top of a puff pastry or pie crust dough is a sure way to have a soggy, chewy bottom crust. It will heat up the cold butter, melt it, and prevent the formation of those flaky layers you'd want to have in a pie. You can put the filling in the fridge or a cool place for a few minutes until at least room-temperature before having it come in contact with the puff pastry.

The ingredients you are adding them to are hot enough to melt them on the spot so save yourself mushy peas and skip that step.

I had to add some water to the gravy mixture because there wasn't much left after cooking everything else. I might use 2 cans of beef broth next time.

Very good flavor, I don't think it could pass as the real deal but certainly will pass this on to EVERY vegetarian/vegan I know (I think vegan use br. sugar in lieu of honey).

I did think it needed more flavour though, but I wanted to follow the recipe for the first time. The next time I make it, I\\u2019ll maybe add some garlic and onion powder to the flour too. I read the reviews before cooking, so after 5 mins hot frying, 10 mins cooler and a few mins on hot again, I then put them into the Ninja on 170 for 10 mins.

And i believe it, bc the recipe i used was a tad step up but i wasn't excited about the flavor, and it's a bit too salty. I had 5 chicken legs (not quite 2#) brined overnight, rinsed and let it drain and warm with ambient temperature. I substitute buttermilk, 1/8C almond milk to 3/8C to make 1/2C \\\"buttermilk\\\" substitute; for the mix i used: 1.5C flour, 1T salt (plan to cut to 2tsp next time!), 1T black pepper, 1/2T garlic, 1/4T onion, 1/2tsp paprika, 1/2tsp red(cayenne) pepper; I used my carbon steel wok and had it filled with just enough oil to submerge half the chicken. Fried the first side for 15min before flipping to other side for 10min to try to mitigate overfrying.

But it didn't turn out as good as I hoped (there was still none left, mind you). I'm going to do it again now that I know the following:\\n\\n1. After reading MANY reviews I finally found one reviewer (AFTER I cooked it) who revealed the flour can take 30 minutes to reach that \\\"pasty\\\" consistency, which is critical to this working. The recipe doesn't give you an idea how long it takes, so if you've never done it you really don't know how long you should expect it to take. That may explain people jumping the gun on this step (like I did).\\n\\n2. I think real Buttermilk (not a substitute like I used) is a critical component to getting that paste. I could be wrong here but I'll use the real stuff next time.\\n\\n3. Mine was a little bland, like many others. But I think that's because if you're someone who likes to taste a lot of seasoning it takes a lot more than the recipe calls for to cut through 2 cups of flour. I could taste it a little but I'll add quite a bit more next time.\\n\\n4. I used one of these counter-top electric fryer-type things, so I was able to dial in the temp to 375. But my chicken got more brown than I wanted it to, and it got there pretty quickly. Even without fully reaching the pasty phase though, I could tell the skin was definitely different.\\n\\nNext time I'll either cook it at a lower temp or omit the Paprika, since it's a browning agent.\\n\\nOther things were a little unclear because the instructions differe\"}, {\"@type\": \"Review\", \"reviewRating\": {\"@type\": \"Rating\", \"ratingValue\": \"5\"}, \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"name\": \"GrandmasKitchen07\"}, \"reviewBody\": \"I never knew how to make fried chicken so I never made it.

But do make sure that after you dip (or marinate) in buttermilk you toss the chicken in a bag with the flour mixture (in batches) and let it sit**** for at least 30 minutes!!!. Also I did follow instructions and covered the chicken while it was sitting in the flour mixture, I think this helps keep the coating wet. I used my cold oven to house the cookie sheets with the covered chicken. 20 min after I started heating up the oil in a cast iron dutch oven and by the time 30-35min passed the oil was hot and ready. The chicken is going to have a sticky paste coating when ready. One more thing, make sure your oil is hot and stays hot. Between 350*F to 375*F. I made chicken wings and boneless strips so I didn't have to cover and let cook for 30 min. 10-12 min is all my chicken needed.

Most people think that risotto is crazy complicated and difficult, but this recipe has just a few ingredients and very little stirring involved but you still get that creamy, comforting result. Let's get started. Let's talk about the star of the show, the risotto rice. To make risotto, you're going to need either arborio or carnaroli rice. So let's talk about those two. They're very similar. Both are short grained and they have this very starchy coating on the outside and that's the thing that's essential to get that creamy, creamy texture we're looking for. Arborio rice, when it's cooked, will cook a little bit faster and also can go mushy faster if you overcook it. Carnaroli, on the other hand, is going to hold its shape and appear more distinct, even when it's fully cooked. And for that reason, I honestly prefer it. This is the one that we're going to be using today. So the first thing that we're going to do is to get our broth in a pot and get it all warmed up, just to a bare simmer so that it's ready when we need it for our risotto. Next to the rice, the broth is the most important ingredient in risotto because whatever your broth tastes like, your risotto's gonna taste like. So actually taste your broth. Like, when you buy it from the store, actually try it. If you don't like what it tastes like just on its own, you are not gonna like what your risotto ends up tasting like. Another thing, definitely always get low sodium. Low sodium broth is great because it allows you to control the salt level of your dish. You can always add more salt if it's not salty enough, you can't take it away. While our broth is warming up, we are gonna get our onions started so we are gonna add some butter to our pan and then the chopped onions along with a little pinch of salt. We are gonna cook those down until they're nice and sweet and translucent, should take about eight to 10 minutes. Our broth is simmering now so we're gonna cut the heat and cover it. We just want it to stay warm until we need it. All right, let's see if these are ready. (light music) Yep, we're there. It's soft, it's tender, but not mushy, and it's sweet to the taste. It also tastes like butter. So we are ready now to add our rice. We toast the rice, just for a couple minutes, to intensify the flavor. Toasting is the same thing basically as caramelizing. It's the same thing as when you sear a steak and get those lovely brown bits on the outside. It's gonna deepen and develop the flavor and just make a much more delicious risotto. We're gonna toast this rice, stirring, stirring all the while, just until it starts to go slightly golden on the edges. You don't wanna take it too far, just slightly. See how this is all just nice and golden just around the edges, not too much? That's where you want it to be when you add your wine. Lots of people think they should go out and buy cooking wine to cook with. You don't need to, just use whatever you would drink. So here I have a nice chardonnay, that's gonna be perfect. Pinot Grigio would be great too. Seriously, whatever you like to drink with your dinner. One exception, you do not wanna use champagne in that, just save it for yourself. Once the wine is gone in, you're gonna just stir it until the liquid is absorbed completely. That should take about three to four minutes. As you can see, most of the liquid is absorbed and all you can really see are those starchy trails the rice is leaving, which is just what you want. Now it's time to add our broth. All right, so now we are gonna take our broth and pour three quarters of it, which is about three cups, into our risotto. We're gonna bring this up to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until the rice is just barely tender, which is about 15 minutes. Most people think that it is sacrilegious to put this much broth in and that you need to add it a little bit at a time, but you really don't. The natural starch on the outside of the rice is what is gonna make this risotto creamy, not the constant stirring. Yes, you should add the last bit of broth little by little because you don't always know how much you're gonna need. I might need this full cup, I might need only half of a cup and you don't wanna drown your risotto so you're going to finish the last bit slowly by hand stirring, but most of it, it can just do its thing by itself. That rice has got it covered. It doesn't need you. So our rice has been simmering for 15 minutes. The liquid is absorbed and it looks like it should be just about tender. This is the point when we are going to start adding in the remaining broth, bit by bit, like you would think you would traditionally. At this point, the liquid that we just added is absorbed but before we add the rest, we're gonna taste and see if it's tender. You don't want it mushy at all. You just want it to be al dente. (light music) It's almost there. It just needs the rest of that broth. (light music) All right, that's ready. It's tender, but it's not mushy and that's exactly where you want it to be. We're gonna cut the heat now and finish it off. So to finish our risotto, we're just gonna add a little bit more butter, a lot of Parmesan cheese, pepper, and salt to taste. It's creamy and comforting, and while it did take some care and attention, it definitely did not take 30 minutes of nonstop stirring in front of the stove. This is comfort food that you can make on a weeknight. It can be ready for your family in no time flat but it's also elegant and classy enough that you can make it maybe for a date night, maybe to impress. It's rich and just so comforting and soul-satisfying. This is the king of comfort food. The broth is giving that incredible, just simple but dependable back note of flavor. You get the nice acidity from the wine that's been cooked out and then the Parmesan comes in to give that rich nuttiness and that little bit of salt. And the black pepper is the perfect accent that goes over the top. If you have leftovers, which I doubt, you can always save them in the refrigerator and then the next day, you can roll this day old risotto into balls and deep fry it, make some arancini, delicious.

Anyone who enjoyed this should consider using Chef John's recipe for chicken fried steak, since the batter is different and IMO, only SLIGHTLY better than this one - mostly due to the fact that the baking soda used in the other one makes the breading a little more fluffy. Still, the flavor on these was amazing, and I didn't have the time to marinade in the buttermilk (only about 40 minutes). I really winged it since I had a lot more chicken than is listed in recipe. Also I had a couple of chicken breasts that I cut to be more or less the same size as the tenderloins. My suggestions/modifications: I could have used half the flour called for. I also cut back a little on the cayenne since my picky kids donna lika the spicy! :D\\n\\nAlso, I would pull the chicken out earlier than I did and that is suggested in recipe. Some of my pieces were extremely juicy, but most were just a BIT dry. Of course I used a blend of peanut and canola since I didn't have enough peanut, and put about 2-3 inches deep oil in a large, deep skillet (I don't own a dutch oven).

It made enough for 2 people, eating two generous portions each, and it's easy and cheap enough for a weeknight meal.\\n\\nI was out of fresh garlic, and don't normally have fresh parsley or worcestershire sauce, so I subbed garlic powder, dried parsley, and seasoned salt. It was actually very good, even without fresh ingredients. I used 3/4 lb. of button mushrooms, next time I'd use at least a pound. I used 3/4 bag of egg noodles. Next time, I would use the whole bag (there was enough sauce left over for one more medium-small portion.)\\n\\nSauce: I would add less flour next time. This one is because of my technique, I cooked the sauce for a few extra minutes to get rid of the floury taste, and the sauce continued to thicken. I added about 4 scoops of pasta water to thin it (bonus is it helps the sauce stick to the pasta) while it cooked. I whisked the flour in without the sour cream, after adding the veggies back in, thinking it would work, and there were a few lumps I had to scoop out. Next time, I'd add the flour and whisk before adding the veggies back in. I added 1/2 Tablespoon of soy sauce as well, and I think that really made it. I actually thought the sauce was really good without the sour cream, so if you're out of it or with someone who doesn't like it, you could maybe add a pat or two of butter instead.
