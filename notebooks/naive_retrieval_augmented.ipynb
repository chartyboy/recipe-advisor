      "page_content='Recipe Name: Working with Chocolate by Jacques Torres, \\nIngredients: , \\nCooking Instructions: 1. Melting Chocolate:\\n2. Chocolate melts best at temperatures between 104 and 113 degrees F (40 and 45 C). Never melt chocolate directly over a heat source. Use an indirect heat source like a hot water bath so the chocolate reaches a temperature of 104 to 113 degrees F (40 to 45 C). This is the perfect temperature to begin tempering.\\n3. Tempering Chocolate:\\n4. Tempering is important because it determines the final gloss, hardness, and contraction of the chocolate. When you melt chocolate, the molecules of fat separate. In order to put them back together, you temper it. There are a variety of ways to do it.\\n5. One of the easiest ways to temper it is to place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. Be careful; the chocolate will not look like it has melted because it retains its shape. The chocolate should be only slightly warmer than your bottom lip. You may still see lumps in it but, don¿t worry; the residual heat of the chocolate will melt them. You can also use an immersion blender to break up the lumps and start the recrystallization process. Usually, the chocolate begins to set (recrystallize) along the side of the bowl. As it begins to crystallize, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate and they will begin the recrystallization process. I like to use glass bowl because it retains the heat and keeps the chocolate tempered a long time.\\n6. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, tempering is achieved by adding small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate but is usually one fourth of the total amount. I usually use an immersion blender to mix the two together.\\n7. The classic way to temper chocolate is call tabliering. Chocolate is melted over a hot water bath to a temperature between 88 and 90 degrees F (31 to 34 C). (White and milk chocolate are melted to a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less, depending on the amount of milk fat they contain.) Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured on a cold table or marble surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until the temperature of the chocolate is approximately 81 degrees F (27 C). At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining one third of non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass in the bowl has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is further worked on the cold table until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room and makes a big mess.\\n8. Checking Tempering:\\n9. A simple method of checking tempering is by applying a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within 5 minutes.\\n10. Storing Chocolate:\\n11. You need to use enough to make it easy to work with so you will always have extra chocolate in molding most of these recipes. Chocolate is susceptible to moisture and absorbs external odors. It is also important to protect it from light and air. Store it in a cool dry place in closed packaging. The ideal temperature for storing chocolate is between 54 and 68 degrees F (12 and 20 C). Do not store chocolate in the refrigerator where the humidity (moisture) will affect it.\\n12. A soft white layer on the surface of chocolate is called fatbloom. It is caused when a thin layer of fat crystals forms on the surface of the chocolate. Storage at a constant temperature will delay the appearance of fatbloom.\\n13. Sugarbloom is a rough and irregular layer on top of the chocolate caused by condensation (when chocolate is taken out of the refrigerator). This moisture will dissolve the sugar in the chocolate. When the water evaporates, the sugar recrystallizes into rough, irregular crystals on the surface and gives the chocolate an unpleasant look. Prevent sugarbloom by preventing temperature shocks., '\n",

      "Recipe Name: Chicken Noodle Soup, \n",
      "Ingredients: 3 liters (about 12 1/2 cups) Chicken Stock, recipe follows, 2 chicken breasts (about 450 grams/1 pound), 2 teaspoons olive oil, 1/4 red or yellow onion, diced, 2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1-centimeter (about 1/2-inch) rounds, 1 stalk celery, cut into 1-centimeter (about 1/2-inch) slices, 1/4 fennel bulb, diced, Kosher salt, Freshly ground black pepper, 1 garlic clove, minced, 1/4 teaspoon turmeric, 1 1/2 cups broad egg noodles, 2 small handfuls Swiss chard or kale, stems removed and roughly chopped, 1/2 lemon, juiced, 2 tablespoons finely chopped dill, parsley or fennel fronds, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 kilograms whole chicken carcasses (2 3/4 to 3 1/3 pounds), 3 celery stalks, 3 medium carrots, 1 large yellow onion, 1/2 head of garlic, 1 handful parsley stalks, 5 sprigs thyme, 2 bay leaves, 1 teaspoon black peppercorns, 2 teaspoon kosher salt, \n",
      "Cooking Instructions: 1. Pour the chicken stock into a large saucepan and add in the chicken breasts. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat, cover and let sit for 15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken from the stock and set aside to rest.\n",
      "2. Meanwhile, in another saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat and add in the onion, carrots, celery and fennel. Season with salt and pepper and cook until lightly golden, about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and turmeric and cook for 30 seconds before carefully pouring in the hot chicken stock. Turn the heat up to high, bring to a boil and cook until the vegetables are just tender, about 5 minutes. Add in the egg noodles and cook according to the package directions, or until tender.\n",
      "3. Just before serving, use two forks to shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces and add to the soup along with the greens, lemon juice and herbs and a final seasoning of salt and pepper.\n",
      "4. On a sturdy work surface using a sharp knife, break down the chicken by removing the wings and legs at their joints and splitting the legs into thighs and drumsticks. Carefully remove the breast meat from the carcass and wrap and set aside in the fridge or freezer for later use. Place the broken-down chicken bones, wings, thighs and drumsticks into a large stockpot.\n",
      "5. Roughly chop the celery and carrots into large chunks and add them to the pot. Leave the onion unpeeled, cut it in half, and place in the pot along with the garlic, parsley stalks, thyme, bay, peppercorns and salt. Pour 4 liters of water (about 1 gallon) on top, adding more if the veg and chicken are not fully covered.\n",
      "6. Place the pot over high heat, bring to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to low to maintain a low simmer. Simmer the stock for at least 4 hours, occasionally skimming any frothy foam that floats to the surface.\n",
      "7. When the stock is flavourful and the chicken bones fall apart easily when pressed, scoop out as much of the chicken and veg as possible, then strain the stock through a fine mesh sieve. Allow the stock to cool to room temperature before transferring to resealable containers and storing in the fridge for up to one week or in the freezer for up to 6 months. , \n"
