      "- 1 medium white onion, finely chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)\n",
      "- 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided\n",
      "- 1 1/2 cups brown rice, preferably short grain\n",
      "- 1 cup dry white wine\n",
      "- 3 oz. Parmesan, finely grated (about 1 1/2 cups)\n",
      "- 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n",
      "- 8 oz. fresh mushrooms, cleaned and sliced\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons fresh oregano, chopped\n",

      "1. In a medium pot over medium-high heat, heat the vegetable broth until steaming. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and keep the broth warm.\n",

      "3. Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown slightly, around 5 to 7 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Next, stir in the brown rice and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, until it starts to become translucent around the edges.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Pour in the wine and cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid is fully absorbed by the rice, approximately 3 to 4 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Now, gradually add the warm vegetable broth one cup at a time, stirring frequently. Wait until the broth is mostly absorbed before adding the next cup. Continue this process, constantly stirring, until the brown rice is tender and creamy, about 35 to 45 minutes. Brown rice generally takes longer to cook than arborio rice, hence the extended cooking time.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Once the rice is cooked to your liking, remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the grated Parmesan, the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, ground pepper, and the fresh oregano. Adjust the seasoning with the remaining 2 teaspoons of salt if necessary.\n",
